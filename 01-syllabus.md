### Advanced Computer Architecture (CS251a)
* Instructor: Tony Nowatzki
* Term Fall 2018

### Course Objectives

Computer architecture is the glue that binds the worlds of hardware and software. Developing new archtiectures is the art and science of understanding the intrinsic properties of applications, developing and interconnecting hardware components to meet cost and performance goals, and creating abstractions that enable efficient use of hardware without sacrificing generality. 

Several important specific goals are:

* Be able to reason about relationship between application properties and how they are exploited by architecture/microarchitecture mechanisms.
* Gain intuition and reasoning skills regarding fundamental architecture tradeoffs of hardware design choices (performance/area/power/complexity/generality).
* Understand microarchitecture techniques behind extracting instruction level parallelism and mechanisms for exploiting locality.
* Gain appreciation for state-of-the-art microprocessors.
* Learn about evaluation methods, including simulation, analytical modeling, and mechanistic models.  Specific focus on [gem5](http://learning.gem5.org/).

### Course Components:

Logistically, this course has 4 components.  
* Reviews: During this course we will read a number of research papers from literature, including classic and modern works.  You will write a short review, to be submtited over CCLE, for one or two papers each week. See [review]({{site.baseurl}}/06-reviews/) page for more instructions.
* Homeworks:  There will be a 3-4 homeworks during the quarter, in which you will apply your knowledge to real-world architecture evaluation.  These homeworks will mostly revolve around gem5.  See [homeworks]({{site.baseurl}}/07-homeworks/) page for more instructions.
* Exames:  There will be two midterm exams during the quarter.

### Required Texts

There is no required textbook.  Required reading will include [Morgan Claypool
Synthesis Lectures](https://www.morganclaypool.com/toc/cac/1/1) as well as a
set of published papers (available on campus nextwork through
[ACM](http://www.acm.org/dl) and [IEEE](http://www.ieee.org/ieeexplore)
libraries).

### Optional Texts

The following are excellent textbooks for reference on related material.  I
highly recommend them if learning from textbooks meets your learning style
better than papers/in-class discussion alone.

* John Shen and Mikko Lipasti, Modern Processor Design: Fundamentals of Superscalar Processors, McGraw-Hill, 2005.
* John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson, Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Sixth Edition.
