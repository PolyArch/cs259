title: Forum Discussions
---

Students are expected to have completed the assigned readings before class and
participate in discussions.  As stated in the syllabus, you may either
fulfill this requirement by writing thoughtful posts in the forum,
by speakign up in class, or some combination of both.

## Forum Post Guidelines:

The goal of the pre-class forum discussions is to bring up meaningful questions and
insights for the presenter, and to prime the class to be thinking critically
about the work. 

There are no strict format requirements for contributions to the forum. You may
do a traditional review if you like, or you may simply highlight what you
thought was interesting or pose a few questions.  Your contribution can even be
to respond to other peoples questions, without having to write your own
top-level post first.

#### Examples of things you can write about:
* Summarize the main intellectual contributions of the paper.
* Describe the paperâ€™s weaknesses, or concerns about the validity of their conclusions, or validity of their results.
* Share something you found surprising, interesting, or contradictory in relation to other papers we have read.
* Write a thoughtful question about the design or algorithm.
* Describe ways that this work could contribute to future work, or open interesting future questions.

## FAQ

#### Length?
I would say try for two paragraphs or so.  Maybe ~8-10 sentences, or more if you feel its valuable.

#### When is it due? 
If you are doing a top-level review type post (which tends to be the
norm, even though I'd like more back-and-forth discussion), please post
the night before class. The reason being that the presenter can get a chance to
see what questions/concerns and interests people have about the paper.  If none
of the responses are in by the morning, then that becomes impossible.  You can
make other contributions on the day of (responding,follow-ups,etc), but this 
still must be done before class.

#### What if I can't participate because of X?
 No problem, you may skip 2 discussions without penalty, and I will
take only your highest scores.

#### Do I need to participate in both papers if there are two in one day?

No, you only need to participate in one paper.

#### Do I need to participate in the discussion if I'm presenting that day?

Instead, you should present a few discussion questions / discussion topics for your paper.  Each presenter should contribute at least one question.
