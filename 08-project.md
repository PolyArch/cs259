title: Course Project
---

The final component of this course is a project; there is no final exam.  The
topic would ideally be selected/proposed by week 5.
 
### Quick Facts

* Due Date:
* Subject:  If it has a relationship to ML & hardware, its acceptable!
* Work in teams: Yes, 2-4 Students
* Deliverables: Project Report + Source Code tarball

## Project Content

The goal of the project is to give you an opportunity to get hands-on
experience with architecture experimentation and maybe even research. 

 Propose a research idea and evaluate it using any means you
   like.  You are free to combine with ongoing research from your own studies,
or with another course, provided the scope of the project implementation 
submitted for this course is sufficient.  Please see me if this is unclear.

## Report guidelines:

The final project report should document the work that you have performed and
the findings.  You should strive to make the presentation of your report the
same quality as the papers you have read during the quarter, even if it ends up
being much shorter. The paper should stand alone as well -- the concepts should
be understandable by your classmates without having to read additional papers
(ie. including relationship to existing work). Please format the paper nicely,
and organize the paper with good structure.  *Finally, please include a
statement of work which describes how each student contributed to the project*.

As you may have noticed, papers typically follow one of a few canonical
structures. The one below is a reasonable approach.

* Abstract: Summarize the main contribution(s), and list any key findings.
* Introduction: Describe the problem your work addresses, why it is important, and overview the
solution (if you are proposing one).
* Related Work: Overview the relationship of your work to prior work, with citations. It's of course
okay if the work is not 100% novel.
* Methods: Detail the proposed design or methods (this may span one or more sections). This includes
the design of any algorithms, hardware structures, interface strategies, codesign techniques, etc. Be
sure to use drawings/figures/code-examples that can help explain the ideas.
* Methodology: Describe your approach for how you evaluated the work, and explain why it is fair or
valid.
* Evaluation: Provide and analyze any quantitative results.
* Conclusions: Summarize the findings and main contributions, as well as any ideas for future work.
* Statement of Work: For each person in the group, describe the tasks that they performed.
* References: List all references cited.
