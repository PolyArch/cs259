The final component of this course is a project; there is no final exam.  The
topic would ideally be selected/proposed by week 5.
 
### Quick Facts

* Due Date: June 10th, Midnight
* Subject:  If it has a relationship to ML & hardware, its acceptable!
* Work in teams: Yes, 1-4 Students (preferrably 2-3)
* Deliverables: Project Report + Source Code tarball (will not distribute)

## Project Content

The goal of the project is to give you an opportunity to get hands-on
experience with architecture experimentation and maybe even research. 

 Propose a research idea and evaluate it using any means you
   like.  You are free to combine with ongoing research from your own studies,
or with another course, provided the scope of the project implementation 
submitted for this course is sufficient.  Please see me if this is unclear.

## Report guidelines:

The final project report should document the work that you have performed and
the findings.  You should strive to make the presentation of your report the
same quality as the papers you have read during the quarter, even if it ends up
being much shorter. The paper should stand alone as well -- the concepts should
be understandable by your classmates without having to read additional papers
(ie. including relationship to existing work). Please format the paper nicely,
and organize the paper with good structure.  *Finally, please include a
statement of work which describes how each student contributed to the project*.

As you may have noticed, papers typically follow one of a few canonical
structures. The one below is a reasonable approach.

* Abstract: Summarize the main contribution(s), and list any key findings.
* Introduction: Describe the problem your work addresses, why it is important, and overview the
solution (if you are proposing one).
* Related Work: Overview the relationship of your work to prior work, with citations. It's of course
okay if the work is not 100% novel.
* Methods: Detail the proposed design or methods (this may span one or more sections). This includes
the design of any algorithms, hardware structures, interface strategies, codesign techniques, etc. Be
sure to use drawings/figures/code-examples that can help explain the ideas.
* Methodology: Describe your approach for how you evaluated the work, and explain why it is fair or
valid.
* Evaluation: Provide and analyze any quantitative results.
* Conclusions: Summarize the findings and main contributions, as well as any ideas for future work.
* Statement of Work: For each person in the group, describe the tasks that they performed.
* References: List all references cited.

## Project Ideas

A few broad project ideas are below.  These are meant as examples; projects that
don't fit into any of these categories are acceptable.

### Accelerator for Machine Learning Kernel: 

This project is straightforward, but very broad: design/evaluate a hardware accelerator for an ML
algorithm of interest.  There are different facets of this to think about to
create an interesting problem:

* Algorithm to target:  Any ML algorithm of interest, or set of algorithms,
  could be chosen.  Simple FC/CNN layers are acceptable, but to make things
more interesting compared to what we've focused on in class, you could also
consider specializing to different networks like
[LSTMs](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/),
[transformer](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html)/[BERT](https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270), [graph networks](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/), etc.
Going in a completely different direction are other classic ML algorithms
[(top 5 facebook algos)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8327042) 
like GBDT, SVM, LR.

* Algorithm optimizations: Could be interesting to try different optimizations
for accelerators (eg. winograd?), or combine different sources of efficiency in
one accelerator (how to combine exploiting sparsity with bit-level optimizations?).

* Type of accelerator: The accelerator can either be fixed-function, take
algorithm-specific commands (eg. NN layer parameters), or be more general
to a whole domain.  Each would offer different tradeoffs and can be interesting.

The evaluation criteria could include how large, fast, and power hungry the design
is as compared to some relevant baseline.  You might choose a baseline to be an
existing CPU/GPU code.
For evaluation, you could use a custom simulator, or an analytical model.  Feel
free to use an FPGA if you already have some experience.

### Optimization Framework ###

Timeloop [Timeloop/Accelergy](http://accelergy.mit.edu/tutorial.html) and
[MAESTRO](http://maestro.ece.gatech.edu/) are tools that allow the modeling of performance
and energy based on the dataflow.  These modeling tools can be enhanced in a number of 
ways:

* Add new algorithm features to the model.  For example, add the ability to
do model inter-layer parallelism. 

* Add some new hardware feature: perhaps support for different kinds of sparsity that
we discuss in class.

* These tools require enormous amounts of time to exhaustively search the space of 
transformations to find best one. Propose a technique (perhaps a heuristic technique) to 
search the space more quickly. (Use ML model as cost-model -- ML for ML anyone?)

* Add the ability to automatically search over hardware features under certain area/power/performance
 constraints.
 
### CPU Tensor Cores (or other CPU-core enhancements):  

Implement a tensor core
for a CPU.  [Tensor cores](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensorcore/) have been added to
GPUs to help improve their performance on high-compute-density operations.  This basically boils down
to a few new instructions in the ISA for doing matrix multiply tiles.  One could add these to a CPU
instruction set, and evaluate with gem5.

More broadly, perhaps there are other challenges for CPUs that limit their performance on eg. CNNs.  Another
project could be to run some CNN layers on a CPU simulator, identify the bottlenecks, and show how to 
improve their microarchitecture (or add other instructions).

<!--
Similar to the projects above, except that the focus here would be for improving a general purpose core.  The idea would be to select a workload or workload set, then analyze it to figure out what types of specialized instructions would be beneficial for that set of ML kernels.  This could be evaluated either by modifying a simulator, or by modifying an open-source RTL implementation like the RISCV Rocket core.  An RTL-based project would have a lower bar for complexity of modification.

 Studying Reduced Precision:  

An open question is what should future datatypes look like for training deep
neural networks: how many bits of information (16, 32, something in-between?),
what type of encoding (floating vs fixed point), how many bits for exponent vs
mantissa, etc.  This could be studied rigorously by modifying some kernels in
Tensorflow which are used during training (like conv2d or matmul), and emulate
the results with different data types. Ie. instead of calling into MKL or
CUDNN libraries, the kernels would call your custom version which emulates a
different hardware precision.  Evaluation metrics would include the
data-bandwidth saved, loss in inference accuracy, and reduction in training
time.
-->

### Novel GPU Parallelization:  

Generally, kernels on GPU are parallelized one-at-a-time (ie. one layer
at a time across all CUDA cores).  Sometimes this is inefficient because
there isn't enough work per kernel.  What if two or more kernels were running
at the same time on the GPU (each running its own element of a batch?)?  
This could lead to more efficient execution for a variety of networks.

This could also be done for an accelerator as well!

One could also look into parallelizing other ML algorithms on GPUs like
gradient-boosting tree training, or various algorithms for recommender systems
like alternating least squares.


### Machine learning models for microarchitecture policy optimization:  

There are many microarchitectural policies within programmable architectures (CPUs/GPUs) that are 1. Complicated to design and analyze, 2. Brittle between hardware versions -- requiring redesign, 3. Only optimal for particular workloads.  A machine learning-based approach can potentially mitigate the above.  Some example areas would be:

* Branch Prediction:  This is a classic area in computer architecture thatâ€™s
  seen great success with neural network based prediction.  Would be
interesting to explore different models here.

* Prefetching:  Microarchitectural prefetchers examine an address stream at
  some point in the cache hierarchy (eg. from l2 to l3) and learn the patterns.
They then issue requests in advance to hide memory latency.  Perhaps more
advanced ML techniques can be used here instead of the simple techniques used
so far.

* GPU Warp Scheduling: One challenging aspect of achieving good hardware
  utilization on GPUs is to determine how to choose a Warp (this is the GPU
word for a thread) to execute next -- this is called warp scheduling.  Could we
maybe use reinforcement learning here?

Evaluation: For any computer-architecture study, you can always use a generic
simulator with generic workloads.  For example, you could use [gem5](http://learning.gem5.org/) 
+ SPECINT 2017, which I can provide instructions for downloading. 

The other option is to use the infrastructure from prior microarchitecture
competitions.  

1. [Championship branch prediction](https://www.jilp.org/cbp2016/framework.html)

2. [Data Prefetching Championship](https://dpc3.compas.cs.stonybrook.edu/)

3. [Championship Value Prediction](https://www.microarch.org/cvp1/rules.html)

4. [Memory Scheduling Championship](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/jwac12/)

### Universal Approximation Accelerators:  

Interestingly, some ML algorithms are quite efficient to compute because of
how simple/regular they are.  What's bizarre though, is that if some
error can be tolerated, they can be even sometimes be
more efficient than an existing *exact* algorithm!

The NPU paper (which weâ€™ll discuss) developed an accelerator which is
integrated with a CPU which computes approximate versions of general functions
using neural networks.  They showed that a fully-connected NN-approximated
code, running on their accelerator, is actually faster than precise
computations for certain workloads.  

However, there is still an open question on what the right ML model for automated
approximate computing should be.  The project here could explore different
types of ML models (and model hardware implementations?) which could trade-off
accuracy for performance.
