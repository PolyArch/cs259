Exams will be take-home, and you'll be given 24 hours to answer 3-5 questions.
You may use any resources available to you, asides from looking at answers to
similar questions or consulting with anyone else about the answers.  Questions
are not intended to require very long answers, however, and the entire exam
should be take-able within 1-3 hours, depending on your writing speed.  It could
take much longer and be more stressful, of course, if you need to do re-read
papers to answer the questions.  These questions will be primarily short-essay
questions, focusing on concept synthesis and relationships.  
I will only test on subjects that are discussed in
class or are in the required readings, though the question may be regarding an aspect which we did not directly discuss.

My intention behind using take-home exams is to encourage deep reflection on
concepts we learned about (rather than focusing on material-cramming) and also
to give you practice for making arguments and writing prose.

### Academic Honesty
It goes without saying that that even though this is a take-home exam, you may
not consult with others about the questions -- it is intended to be an individual
test.  This is an experiment on trust; please follow the rules so that I can
continue to have take-home tests in the future.

### Practice Exams 

Since this is the first time we are doing this form of test
in this course, there are no sample exams to give you from previous years.
However, I will likely follow a style similar to the [UW architecture
qual](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/academics/graduate-programs/guidebook/arch-qual).
There are a number of questions there that are excellent, but some
of them are of-course out-of-scope, feel free to ask if it is not clear.

I pulled a few from the above which are questions that I think would be relevant.  The ones
on our test may be slightly more specific to the material that we have covered.
