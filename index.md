### Description

The advancements and overwhelming success of Machine Learning has profoundly
affected the future of computer architecture. Not only is performing learning
on big-data the leading application driver for future architectures, but also
machine learning techniques can be used to improve hardware efficiency for a
wide variety of application domains.

This course will explore, from a computer architecture perspective, the
principles of hardware/software codesign for machine learning. One thrust of
the course will delve into accelerator, CPU, and GPU enhancements for ML
algorithms, including parallelization techniques. The other thrust of the
course will focus on how machine learning can be used to optimize conventional
architectures by dynamically learning and adapting to program behavior.

### Is this a machine learning course?

Not really -- the computation behind machine learning and how that is exploited with 
hardware is what is most relevant here.  That said, I welcome ML experts, or even projects
that focus on the algorithm aspect of a problem (provided there is some relationship to hardware or
hardware support).

### Prerequisites

It is recommended that you have taken some course about computer architecture,
either CS151b or CS251a/b.  Expected background includes basic knowledge of
simple hardware pipelines (ie. how does an inorder processor work?).

All of that said, we will spend time going in depth on background/review during
the first two-or-so weeks to build a foundation for more advanced architecture
concepts.
