### Description

Computer architecture is the glue that binds the worlds of hardware and
software. Developing new archtiectures is the art and science of understanding
the intrinsic properties of applications, developing and interconnecting
hardware components to meet cost and performance goals, and creating
abstractions that enable efficient use of hardware without sacrificing
generality.  This course qualitatively and quantitatively explores the
tradeoffs of architecture and hardware design for general purpose computers.
For example, we will learn how applications exhibit different forms of
instruction-level parallelism, and how these are exploited with concurrent
execution, even though the OS remains completely oblivious.  We will study
evolution of ISAs, how VLSI technology has influenced processor design, and the
importance of locality in developing efficient memory systems.

This course will also emphasize evaluation methods, including simulation and
anaytical modeling, and will teach the use through homeworks and projects with
gem5.

### Prerequisites

It is recommended that you have taken the equivalent of cs151b.
