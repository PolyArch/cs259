### Description

Computer architecture is the glue that binds the worlds of hardware and
software. Developing new architectures is the art and science of understanding
the intrinsic properties of applications, developing and interconnecting
hardware components to meet cost and performance goals, and creating
abstractions that enable efficient use of hardware without sacrificing
generality.  This course qualitatively and quantitatively explores the
tradeoffs of architecture and hardware design for general purpose computers.
For example, we will learn how applications exhibit different forms of
instruction-level parallelism, and how these are exploited with concurrent
execution, even though the OS remains completely oblivious.  We will study
evolution of ISAs, how VLSI technology has influenced processor design, how
modern out-of-order pipelines work, and how locality is exploited
in to create efficient memory systems.

This course will also emphasize evaluation methods, including simulation and
analytical modeling, and will teach the use through homeworks with gem5. The final will also typically involve gem5.

### Prerequisites

It is recommended that you have taken the equivalent of UCLA's CS151b.  Expected
background includes basic knowledge of ISAs and architecture principles,
hardware pipelines, and operating systems.  Ie. if push comes to shove, it is expected that you could design a simple low-performance processor.  

All of that said, we will spend time going in depth on background/review during
the first two-or-so weeks to build a foundation for more advanced architecture
concepts.

### News
