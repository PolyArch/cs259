### Courses

* *CS33: Introduction to Computer Organization*  This course is designed to
demystify computer systems, covering the basics of computer architecture,
computer organization, operating systems and concurrency.  First we will build
from the bottom up with detailed explanations of number systems, how they are
employed in the instruction set architecture.  Then, using x86 as an example,
we explain how programs are represented to the hardware, how to view and
manipulate these abstractions (eg. procedure calls, stacks, interrupts, and
traps) directly in assembly language, and how operating systems provide
virtualization and process management.  We finally demonstrate how this
knowledge applies to improving system security and performance.

* *CS 259: Heterogeneity and the Specialization Spectrum*
This class explores the benefits and drawbacks of
specialization, as well as the challenges in architecture design, compilation
and programming models.  Topics: heterogeneous multicores, instruction set
specialization, programmable vector and dataflow co-processors, memories,
domain-specific architectures and supporting dynamic compilers/runtimes.
