title: Recruiting

I am actively recruiting highly motivated students who are ready to take on
ambitious challenges.  If you are interested in computer architecture
research at UCLA, please feel free to send me a short email with your 
research interests.  

I am broadly interested in architecture, microarchitecture, compilers and
programming languages to support demanding applications on next generation
hardware.  Constraints on technology are pushing architects to develop
customized hardware for different application scenarios, and there is growing
consensus that significant degrees of heterogeneity are necessary.  Much of the
burden of improving computer systems will be on computer architects, not only
in designing new hardware, but also in figuring out how to rapidly codesign the
many components of systems (eg. compilers and architecture).  This is exciting
for architects because our task is critical and extremely challenging.

My research requires a variety of different skills and expertise, including:

* Strong general coding skills (C, C++, Python, ...)
* Hardware Simulators and Modeling 
* Hardware design and prototyping (Verilog, Synthesis, FPGA experience...)
* Compiler Implementation (LLVM, clang, GCC...)
* Application Development (databases, machine learning, computer vision...)

If you have some of the above skills and are passionate about architecture
research, please feel free to reach out.  If you are on campus, please feel
 free to stop by and say hello!
