Link to the [paper reading schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1exgUVCX843lj7EbDo_NZTwRekplsM9QiUk34bsITsTE/edit).  

The schedule partially depends on which papers you select!  You will sign up
for a slot by highlighting a paper and leaving a comment with your names.  I'd
like you select a paper to lead by April 8th -- please follow the directions on
the linked google doc.
