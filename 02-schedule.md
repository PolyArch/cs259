Link to the [paper reading schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KOqo3h1Ly7PgW6Fsj0F0TmA-xg2WOIweY6wLP9OkX8o/edit).  The schedule partially depends on which papers you select!  You will sign up for a slot by highlighting a paper and leaving a comment with your names.  I'd like you select a paper to lead by April 8th -- please follow the directions on the linked google doc.

# Piazza Discussion Guidelines

The goal of the pre-class piazza discussions is to bring up meaningful questions and
insights for the presenter, and to prime the class to be thinking critically
about the work.  

The required contribution per student is about 8-10 meaningful 
sentences (more is okay!) worth of discussion across that dayâ€™s papers.  It would be helpful if
these are submitted before 9am that day (maximum before noon) -- reason being
that the presenter (often me, but sometimes a student) can get a chance to get
see what questions/concerns and interests people have about the paper.  If none
of the responses are in by the morning, then that becomes impossible.  

Some of you may prefer to write a traditional review, which is usually
something like: 1. describe the goals of the paper, 2. summarize the approach
and/or key takeaways, 3. explain any questions you had or any suggestions for
future work.  You may also just leave a comment on someone else's question.  

You may skip 3 discussions without penalty, and also I will keep track of who is active in class.
