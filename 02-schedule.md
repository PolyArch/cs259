Schedule is in progress, and will depend on which papers you'd like to read.  
The current schedule outline is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cDOiy-sW2crkD10tC7b7ekisetygA-bMRHQnZIpABhs/edit).  Scroll to the bottom to see the reading list which has a number of options to choose from.

I'd like you to send me a proposed paper to lead discussion on by end of week 2.
