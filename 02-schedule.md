title: Reading Schedule
---

Schedule is in progress, and will depend on which papers you'd like to read.  
The current schedule outline is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cDOiy-sW2crkD10tC7b7ekisetygA-bMRHQnZIpABhs/edit).  

I'd like you to send me a proposed paper to lead discussion on by end of week 2. The reading list has a number of options to choose from, and of course you are free to suggest any relevant paper.

Link to [Piazza](http://piazza.com/ucla/spring2019/cs259) for class discussions.

# Piazza Discussion Guidelines

The goal of the pre-class piazza discussions is to bring up meaningful questions and
insights for the presenter, and to prime the class to be thinking critically
about the work.  

The required contribution per student is about 8-10 meaningful 
sentences (more is okay!) worth of discussion across that dayâ€™s papers.  It would be helpful if
these are submitted before 9am that day (maximum before noon) -- reason being
that the presenter (often me, but sometimes a student) can get a chance to get
see what questions/concerns and interests people have about the paper.  If none
of the responses are in by the morning, then that becomes impossible.  

Some of you may prefer to write a traditional review, which is usually
something like: 1. describe the goals of the paper, 2. summarize the approach
and/or key takeaways, 3. explain any questions you had or any suggestions for
future work.  You may also just leave a comment on someone else's question.  

You may skip 2 discussions without penalty, and also I will keep track of who is active in class.
