### PolyArch Research Group

I am forming a new research group with two broad premises.  First, many architecture
families are going to be required to solve future computing system needs.  This is
largly because of the limitations of technology scaling in providing benefits alone, 
making architecture innovation and specialization critical.  The second is that in
order to manage and harness the complexity of these new systems, we will have to
rethink and redesign current abstractions between the programmer, software stack,
and hardware.

More to come here soon!
