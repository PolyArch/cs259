### GPU Machine

I am providing a shared server for the class to use during the course, primarily as way to use
its GPU.  Its name is ```tetracosa.cs.ucla.edu```.  This machine can only be accessed
from campus (though you could ssh through ```lion.cs.ucla.edu``` for remote access).  You should
also be able to use the VPN as well, let me know if this does not work.

#### Signing Up:
I will provide directions how to sign up over email.
