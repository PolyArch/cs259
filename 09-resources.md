### GPU Machine

I am providing a shared server for the class to use during the course, primarily as way to use
its GPU.  Its name is ```tetracosa.cs.ucla.edu```.  This machine can only be accessed
from campus (though you could ssh through ```lion.cs.ucla.edu``` for remote access).

To get an account, follow these instructions:

```
ssh account@tetracosa.cs.ucla.edu 
account@tetracosa.cs.ucla.edu's password: 
two*too=sixteen #give this line previous line as password, then answer the following: 
Personal name? (first last): Tess Testa 
Username? (small letters or digits only): tt 
Password? (12 or more characters): 
Repeat Password: 
Email? ttesta@ucla.edu 
Repeat Email: ttesta@ucla.edu 
```

after that you will receive this response: 
```
Account configured. It will be activated within one workday.
``` 

* Note 1: It doesn't have a large hard-drive at the moment, so I may need to upgrade if many students are using it and we run out.

* Note 2: No bitcoin mining please. ; )
