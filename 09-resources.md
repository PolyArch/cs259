### GPU Machine

I am providing a shared server for the class to use during the course, primarily as way to use
its GPU.  Its name is ```tetracosa.cs.ucla.edu```.  This machine can only be accessed
from campus (though you could ssh through ```lion.cs.ucla.edu``` for remote access).

#### Important:

* Note 1: The home drive doesn't have a large hard-drive at the moment.  So, please do not put
  any large files in your home directory since it doesn't have much space.
Instead make a folder with your user name within the folder: /usr/eda/cs259/

* Note 2: No bitcoin mining please. ; )

#### Signing Up:
I will provide a username and password to signup with over email.
